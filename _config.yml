user_description: "I'm a Software Engineer, self-made philosopher and avid traveller! Always searching for the next challenge; no task is too scary nor too difficult. Lately I have been working a lot with <b>microservices</b> using the Netflix stack: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Eureka, Ribbon, Zuul and Hystrix. However, one of my leading interests is in <b>hybrid mobile apps</b> development with the Ionic Framework."
